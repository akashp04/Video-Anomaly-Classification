abstract="The proposed research study emphasises the idea of recognising abnormalities in surveillance videos, which are by far the most widely used source of anomaly data. The suggested methodology includes the development of an algorithm capable of detecting anomalies with better accuracy and precision than previously developed methodologies. The model has gone through stages of development. The development phases comprise extracting features from surveillance videos using pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, i.e. DenseNet121, from the transfer learning technique and training the model with appropriate hyperparameters to categorise the anomalies. We also used labels that are labelled at the frame level to classify the video. The model was trained, and hyperparameters were adjusted until the best results were obtained. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score obtained on the UCF crime dataset was 82.91{\%}, which is better than many previously published state-of-art results. We also contrasted the AUC score data for several deep learning methodologies proposed by other researchers to demonstrate the competitiveness and efficiency of our methodology.",
